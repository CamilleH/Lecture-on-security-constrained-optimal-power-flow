  abstract = {This paper is a sequel to and builds upon the survey paper on optimal power flow (OPF) [4]. It provides an up-to-date critical review of the recent major advancements in the OPF state-of-the-art since 2010, identifies further challenging developments needed in order to adapt to the transition toward smarter grids, and indicates ways to address these challenges. The paper focuses on three main topics which are reviewed in chronological order of appearance: deterministic OPF, risk-based OPF, and OPF under uncertainty. A special attention is paid to the algorithms for the core optimizers intervening in the master and slave nonlinear programming problems resulting from OPF decomposition.},

  doi = {10.1109/PTC.2015.7232442},
  abstract = {Swissgrid (the Swiss TSO) introduced a new framework for real-time network security management supported by three main pillars: a) a revised operational planning procedure; b) a near real-time decision support tool performing an unambiguous optimal redispatch of power plants based on an AC security-constrained optimal power flow (AC-SCOPF); and c) a financial incentive for power plants involved in these redispatch procedures. This paper outlines these main concepts and describes in detail the practical aspects of the used AC-SCOPF tool. These new procedures and tool are in operation since early 2013. The paper also describes the main challenges faced during the AC-SCOPF tool integration into the Swissgrid operations.},

With the rise of the Internet age, the trend in information and communication technologies is moving toward Grid computing and Web services, or Grid services.
